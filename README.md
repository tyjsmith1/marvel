## Description
We are creating a website that allows users to view details about their favorite Marvel characters and simulate a battle between a hero and villian.

## MVP
### Core Deliverables
User stories - As a user:
- I should be able to view details of a specific hero or villian by clicking on the name in the list
- I should be able to like my favorite hero or villian
- I should be able to see which character would win in a one-on-one fight

### Stretch Goals
1) Users can like specific characters and this info is stored on the server
2) Hero and Villian win stats are updated to server after each fight
3) Pictures change whenever a character loses (ex: sad spiderman)

## API
We are going to create our own JSON server with the following 10 characters (5 heroes, 5 villians):
- Thor
- IronMan
- spiderman
- black panther
- scarlet witch
- juggernaut
- red skull
- venom
- magneto
- loki

Example JSON:
{
  "characters": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Thor",
      "image": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chris_Hemsworth_as_Thor.jpg#/media/File:Chris_Hemsworth_as_Thor.jpg",
      "description": "Thor wields a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, and is initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among the Nine Realms under Asgard's protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted brother, Loki.",
      "class": "hero",
      "wins": 4,
      "losses": 3,
      "likes": 10
      }
    ]
